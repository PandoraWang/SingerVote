#Blockchain Application For Singer Ballot

### Project Description 

1. **Overview:** In this project we deveploed a Dapp for a voting system which could be applied in a singer contest
2. **Background Information:**Singer is the most popular music competition show in China. It features a very varied cast of singers performing each week, usually with seven singers, who performed for a 500-member audience. The votes cast from the audience were the sole determinant for the results. However, since the vote counting is not transparent, a rumor is always there, saying that cheating exists in the ballot. Therefore, a smart contract for Singer Ballot has come to our mind , we believed that this end-to-end decentralized(Dapp) technology could solve this problem.
